Content Management System based on .NET 6 MVC client, .NET 6 Web API server, with IdentityServer4 as authorization server. 
This project is complete application of MVC client, REST API server and IS4 authorization server.
REST API is built using onion architecture. It is using CQRS and Mediator (by using MediatR library) design patterns.
For unit tests, I used xUnit framework.
